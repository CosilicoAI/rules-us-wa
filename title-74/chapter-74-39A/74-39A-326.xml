NOTES:
Findings
—
Intent
—
2017 3rd sp.s. c 34:
&quot;The legislature finds that the most common form of long-term care provided to persons who are elderly, disabled, or have a developmental disability is provided by a family member in a personal residence. The legislature also finds that care provided by a family member who is chosen by the recipient is often the most appropriate form of care, allowing vulnerable individuals to remain independent while maintaining a sense of dignity and choice. The current system of medicaid services has complexities that may create obstacles for consumers who wish to be cared for by a family member and for family members who enter the system solely to provide care for their loved ones.
Therefore, the legislature intends to direct a study of the current options allowing for the delivery of medicaid personal care services by caregivers who are family members of the state's citizens who are aging, disabled, or who have a developmental disability. The legislature intends to promote more flexibility for clients to access their benefits and to reduce obstacles for clients who wish to hire family members to provide their care.&quot; [

Conflict with federal requirements
—
2009 c 571:
&quot;If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict and with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its application to the agencies concerned.</p>
