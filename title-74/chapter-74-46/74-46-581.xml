Separate nursing facility quality enhancement account.
A separate nursing facility quality enhancement account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Beginning July 1, 2015, all net receipts from the reconciliation and settlement process provided in RCW
74.46.022
(6), as described within RCW
74.46.561
, must be deposited into the account. Beginning July 1, 2016, all receipts from the system of financial penalties for facilities out of compliance with minimum staffing standards, as described within RCW
74.42.360
, must be deposited into the account. Only the secretary, or the secretary's designee, may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter
43.88
RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. Except during the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the department shall use the special account only for technical assistance for nursing facilities, specialized training for nursing facilities, or an increase to the quality enhancement established in RCW
74.46.561
, or as necessary for the reconciliation and settlement process, which requires deposits and withdrawals to complete both the preliminary and final settlement net receipt amounts for this account. During the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the account may be expended for funding costs associated with nursing facilities.
