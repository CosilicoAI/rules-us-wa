            <p>It is the intent of the legislature to clarify the right of adults with functional disabilities to choose to self-direct their own health-related tasks through personal aides, and to describe the circumstances under which self-directed care may take place in the home setting. The legislature declares that it is in the public interest to preserve the autonomy and dignity of persons with functional disabilities to care for themselves in their own homes, among the continuum of options for health care services where the judgment and control over the care rests with the individual.&quot; [
