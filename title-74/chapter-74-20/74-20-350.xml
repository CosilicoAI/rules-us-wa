Costs and attorneys' fees.
In order to facilitate and ensure compliance with Title IV-D of the federal social security act, now existing or hereafter amended, wherein the state is required to undertake to establish parentage of such children as are born out of wedlock, the secretary of social and health services may pay the reasonable and proper fees of attorneys admitted to practice before the courts of this state, who are engaged in private practice for the purpose of maintaining actions under chapter
26.26A
or
26.26B
RCW on behalf of such children, to the end that parent and child relationships be determined and financial support obligations be established by superior court order. The secretary or the secretary's designee shall make the determination in each case as to which cases shall be referred for representation by such private attorneys. The secretary may advance, pay, or reimburse for payment of, such reasonable costs as may be attendant to an action under chapter
26.26A
or
26.26B
RCW. The representation by a private attorney shall be only on behalf of the subject child, the custodial natural parent, and the child's personal representative or guardian ad litem, and shall not in any manner be, or be construed to be, in representation of the department of social and health services or the state of Washington, such representation being restricted to that provided pursuant to chapters
43.10
and
36.27
RCW.
