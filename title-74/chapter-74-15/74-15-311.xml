NOTES:
Findings
—
Intent
—
2013 c 105:
&quot;The legislature finds that when a child is removed from his or her home due to suspected abuse or neglect it can take several hours or even days for placement plans to be made for the child during which time caseworkers have to care for the child while also trying to locate an appropriate placement for him or her. The legislature also finds that licensed foster homes are often unable to take a child into their home if his or her care needs have not been thoroughly assessed or he or she is in immediate need of health care or social services. The legislature further finds that there are organizations in our state that are providing or wanting to provide short-term emergency and crisis care for children under the age of thirteen; however, there is currently no appropriate, cost-effective licensure category for organizations to provide these services. The legislature intends to create a resource and assessment center license for agencies to provide short-term emergency and crisis care for children ages birth through twelve, or for children ages thirteen through seventeen who have a sibling under thirteen years of age who have been removed from their homes by child protective services or law enforcement. The legislature further intends that resource and assessment centers be reimbursed at the same rate as foster family homes.&quot; [
