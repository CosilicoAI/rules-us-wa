74.09.402
, through the apple health for kids program authorized in this section, the authority shall provide affordable health care coverage to children under the age of nineteen who reside in Washington state and whose family income at the time of enrollment is not greater than 260 percent of the federal poverty level as adjusted for family size and determined annually by the federal department of health and human services, and effective January 1, 2009, and only to the extent that funds are specifically appropriated therefor, to children whose family income is not greater than 312 percent of the federal poverty level. In administering the program, the authority shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure the receipt of federal financial participation under the medical assistance program, as codified at Title XIX of the federal social security act, the state children's health insurance program, as codified at Title XXI of the federal social security act, and any other federal funding sources that are now available or may become available in the future. The authority and the caseload forecast council shall estimate the anticipated caseload and costs of the program established in this section.</p>

. The application and annual renewal processes shall be designed to minimize administrative barriers for applicants and enrolled clients, and to minimize gaps in eligibility for families who are eligible for coverage. If a change in family income results in a change in the source of funding for coverage, the authority shall transfer the family members to the appropriate source of funding and notify the family with respect to any change in premium obligation, without a break in eligibility. The authority shall use the same eligibility redetermination and appeals procedures as those provided for children on medical assistance programs. The authority shall modify its eligibility renewal procedures to lower the percentage of children failing to annually renew.

Intent

2009 c 463:
&quot;The legislature finds that substantial progress has been made toward achieving the equally important goals set in 2007 that all children in Washington state have health care coverage by 2010 and that child health outcomes improve. The legislature also finds that continued steps are necessary to reach the goals that all children in Washington state shall have access to the health services they need to be healthy and ready to learn and that key measures of child health outcomes will show year by year improvement. The legislature further finds that reaching these goals is integral to the state's ability to weather the current economic crisis. The recent reauthorization of the federal children's health insurance program provides additional opportunities for the state to reach these goals. In view of these important objectives, the legislature intends that the apple health for kids program be managed actively across administrations in the department of social and health services, and across state and local agencies, with clear accountability for achieving the intended program outcomes. The legislature further intends that the department continue the implementation of the apple health for kids program with a commitment to fully utilizing the new program identity with appropriate materials.&quot; [
