              <p>Medicaid enrollees in Washington are challenged with accessing needed behavioral health care. According to the Washington state department of social and health services, as of 2021, among medicaid enrollees with an identified mental health need, only 50 percent of adults and 66 percent of youth received treatment, while among medicaid enrollees with an identified substance use disorder need, only 37 percent of adults and 23 percent of youth received treatment. Furthermore, the national council for mental wellbeing's 2022 access to care survey found that 43 percent of adults in the United States who say they need mental health or substance use care did not receive that care, and they face numerous barriers to receiving needed treatment. Lack of necessary care can cause behavioral health conditions to deteriorate and crises to escalate, driving increasing use of intensive services such as inpatient care and involuntary treatment. As a result, the behavioral health system is reaching a crisis point in communities across the state.</p>

              <p>As of December 2022, 1,953,153 Washington residents rely on apple health managed care organizations to provide for their physical and behavioral health needs. During the integration of physical and behavioral health care pursuant to chapter 225, Laws of 2014, the health care authority most recently procured managed care services in 2018 and selected five managed care organizations to serve as Washington's apple health plans to provide for the physical and behavioral health care needs of medicaid enrollees. The health care authority has begun considering when to conduct a new procurement for managed care organizations, including an allowance for possible new entrants that do not currently serve Washington's medicaid population.</p>

            <p>It is the intent of the legislature to seize this opportunity to address ongoing challenges Washington's medicaid enrollees face in accessing behavioral health care. The legislature intends to establish robust new standards defining the levels of medicaid-funded behavioral health service capacity and resources that are adequate to meet medicaid enrollees' treatment needs; to ensure that managed care organizations that serve Washington's medicaid enrollees have a track record of success in delivering a broad range of behavioral health care services to safety net populations; and to advance payment structures and provider network delivery models that improve equitable access, promote integration of care, and deliver on outcomes.</p>

            <p>The legislature finds that increased access to behavioral health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives, children in foster care, and the aged, blind, and disabled through the preservation and enhancement of the fee-for-service system is also critical to reducing health disparities among these vulnerable populations. The legislature also intends to increase access to timely and robust behavioral health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives, children in foster care, and the aged, blind, and disabled, in the fee-for-service system they access.&quot; [
