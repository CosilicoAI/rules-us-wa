Intent
—
1997 c 58:
&quot;It is the intent of the legislature to provide a strong incentive for persons owing child support to make timely payments, and to cooperate with the department of social and health services to establish an appropriate schedule for the payment of any arrears. To further ensure that child support obligations are met, sections 801 through 890 of this act establish a program by which certain licenses may be suspended or not renewed if a person is one hundred eighty days or more in arrears on child support payments.
In the implementation and management of this program, it is the legislature's intent that the objective of the department of social and health services be to obtain payment in full of arrears, or where that is not possible, to enter into agreements with delinquent obligors to make timely support payments and make reasonable payments towards the arrears. The legislature intends that if the obligor refuses to cooperate in establishing a fair and reasonable payment schedule for arrears or refuses to make timely support payments, the department shall proceed with certification to a licensing entity or the department of licensing that the person is not in compliance with a child support order.&quot; [
