            <p>Charges for services, items, and activities, including those not included in the facility's basic daily rate or not paid by medicaid.
The facility shall provide this information before admission, or at the time of admission in case of emergency, and as changes occur during the resident's stay. The resident and his or her representative must be informed in writing in advance of changes in the availability or charges for services, items, or activities, or of changes in the facility's rules. Except in unusual circumstances, thirty days' advance notice must be given prior to the change. The resident or legal guardian or representative shall acknowledge in writing receipt of this information.
The written information provided by the facility pursuant to this section, and the terms of any admission contract executed between the facility and an individual seeking admission to the facility, must be consistent with the requirements of this chapter and chapter
18.51
RCW and, for facilities certified under medicaid or medicare, with the applicable federal requirements.
