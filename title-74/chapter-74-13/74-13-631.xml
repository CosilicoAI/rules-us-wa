            <p>Consistent with the provisions for making best interest determinations established in RCW
28A.225.350
and
74.13.560
, the department shall provide students who are the subject of a dependency proceeding with the opportunity to remain enrolled in their school of origin, unless the safety of the student is jeopardized, or a relative or other suitable person placement approved by the department is secured for the student, or it is determined not to be in the student's best interest. If the parties in the dependency case disagree regarding which school the student should be enrolled in, the student may remain enrolled in the school of origin until the disagreement is resolved in court, unless the department determines that the student is in immediate danger by remaining enrolled in the school of origin.</p>
