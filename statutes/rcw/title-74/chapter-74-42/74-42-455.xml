            <p>When a nursing facility provides transitional care management services, the facility must coordinate postdischarge care and service needs with in-home agencies licensed under chapter
70.127
RCW, and other authorized care providers, to promote evidence-based transition care planning. In-home service agencies and other authorized care providers, including the department, shall, when appropriate, determine resident eligibility for postdischarge care and services and coordinate with nursing facilities to plan a safe transition of the client to the home setting. When a resident is discharged to home and is without in-home care or services due to the resident's refusal of care or their ineligibility for care, the nursing facility may provide telephone or web-based transitional care management services. These services may include care coordination services, review of the discharge plan, instructions to promote compliance with the discharge plan, reminders or assistance with scheduling follow-up appointments with other health care professionals consistent with the discharge plan, and promotion of self-management of the client's health condition. Web-based transition care services may include patient education and the provision of services described in this section. They are not intended to include telehealth monitoring.</p>

          <content>
            <p>If the nursing facility identifies concerns in client care that result from telephone or web-based transitional care management services, the nursing facility will notify the client's primary care physician. The nursing facility will also discuss with the client options for care or other services which may include in-home services provided by agencies licensed under chapter
70.127
RCW.
