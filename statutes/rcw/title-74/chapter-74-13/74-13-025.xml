Findings

Intent

1998 c 296:
&quot;The legislature finds it is often necessary for parents to obtain mental health or chemical dependency treatment for their minor children prior to the time the child's condition presents a likelihood of serious harm or the child becomes gravely disabled. The legislature finds that treatment of such conditions is not the equivalent of incarceration or detention, but is a legitimate act of parental discretion, when supported by decisions of credentialed professionals. The legislature finds that, consistent with
Parham v. J.R.
, 442 U.S. 584 (1979), state action is not involved in the determination of a parent and professional person to admit a minor child to treatment and finds this act provides sufficient independent review by the department of social and health services, as a neutral fact finder, to protect the interests of all parties. The legislature intends and recognizes that children affected by the provisions of this act are not children whose mental or substance abuse problems are adequately addressed by chapters *70.96A and
71.34
RCW. Therefore, the legislature finds it is necessary to provide parents a statutory process, other than the petition process provided in chapters *70.96A and
71.34
RCW, to obtain treatment for their minor children without the consent of the children.
The legislature finds that differing standards of admission and review in parent-initiated mental health and chemical dependency treatment for their minor children are necessary and the admission standards and procedures under state involuntary treatment procedures are not adequate to provide safeguards for the safety and well-being of all children. The legislature finds the timeline for admission and reviews under existing law do not provide sufficient opportunities for assessment of the mental health and chemically dependent status of every minor child and that additional time and different standards will facilitate the likelihood of successful treatment of children who are in need of assistance but unwilling to obtain it voluntarily. The legislature finds there are children whose behavior presents a clear need of medical treatment but is not so extreme as to require immediate state intervention under the state involuntary treatment procedures.&quot; [
