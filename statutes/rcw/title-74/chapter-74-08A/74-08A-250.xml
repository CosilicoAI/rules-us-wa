Intent
—
2006 c 107:
&quot;The legislature finds that for a variety of reasons, many citizens may lack the basic financial knowledge necessary to spend their money wisely, save for the future, and manage money challenges, such as a job loss, financing a college education, or a catastrophic injury. The legislature also finds that financial literacy is an essential element in achieving financial stability and self-sufficiency. The legislature intends to encourage participation in financial literacy training by WorkFirst participants, in order to promote their ability to make financial decisions that will contribute to their long-term financial well-being.&quot; [
