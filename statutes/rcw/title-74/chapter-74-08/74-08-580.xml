Purpose
—
2012 c 253:
&quot;The legislature finds that fraud associated with public assistance programs is a significant problem in the state of Washington. Therefore, the legislature encourages the office of fraud and accountability within the department of social and health services to coordinate with the office of the state auditor and the *department of early learning to improve the prevention, detection, and prosecution of fraudulent activity taking place in public assistance programs. It is the purpose of this act to significantly reduce fraud and to ensure that public assistance dollars reach the intended populations in need.&quot; [
2012 c 253 s 1
.]
*Reviser's note:
The department of early learning was abolished and its powers, duties, and functions were transferred to the department of children, youth, and families by 2017 3rd sp.s. c 6 s 802, effective July 1, 2018.
