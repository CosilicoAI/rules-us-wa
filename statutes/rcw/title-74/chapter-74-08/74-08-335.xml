Transfers of property to qualify for assistance.
Temporary assistance for needy families and benefits under RCW
74.62.030
and
43.185C.220
shall not be granted to any person who has made an assignment or transfer of property for the purpose of rendering himself or herself eligible for the assistance. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who has transferred or transfers any real or personal property or any interest in property within two years of the date of application for the assistance without receiving adequate monetary consideration therefor, did so for the purpose of rendering himself or herself eligible for the assistance. Any person who transfers property for the purpose of rendering himself or herself eligible for assistance, or any person who after becoming a recipient transfers any property or any interest in property without the consent of the secretary, shall be ineligible for assistance for a period of time during which the reasonable value of the property so transferred would have been adequate to meet the person's needs under normal conditions of living: PROVIDED, That the secretary is hereby authorized to allow exceptions in cases where undue hardship would result from a denial of assistance.
