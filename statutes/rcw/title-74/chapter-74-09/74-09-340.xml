            <p>The legislature finds that through the medicaid program, state and federal government fund long-term care, mental health, and medical services for many elderly persons and people with disabilities, both in institutions and in community alternatives. The legislature also finds that a significant portion of these individuals' social security benefits is retained by the state to assist with the cost of their care. The legislature intends that these individuals retain for their own use a reasonable and modest personal needs allowance which may be used to purchase clothing, postage, barber services, travel, and other personal items not covered by their care setting, in order to promote their autonomy and personal dignity.</p>

            <p>It is the intent of the legislature to adjust the personal needs allowance annually to reflect cost-of-living adjustments to federal social security benefits for medicaid-eligible residents in institutions and community-based residential settings receiving long-term care, developmental disabilities, or mental health services.&quot; [
