            <p>If a buyer normally is engaged in both consuming and reselling certain types of personal property, the retail sale of which is taxable under this chapter, and the buyer is not able to determine at the time of purchase whether the particular property acquired will be consumed or resold, the buyer may use a reseller permit or other documentation authorized under RCW
82.04.470
for the entire purchase if the buyer principally resells the property according to the general nature of the buyer's business. The buyer must account for the value of any articles purchased with a reseller permit or other documentation authorized under RCW
82.04.470
that is used by the buyer and remit the deferred sales tax on the property to the department.</p>

            <p>A buyer who pays a tax on all purchases and subsequently resells property or services at retail, without intervening use by the buyer, must collect the tax from the purchaser as otherwise provided by law and is entitled to a deduction on the buyer's tax return equal to the cost to the buyer of the property or service resold upon which retail sales tax has been paid. The deduction is allowed only if the taxpayer keeps and preserves records that include the names of the persons from whom the property or services were purchased, the date of the purchase, the type of property or services, the amount of the purchase, and the tax that was paid.</p>
