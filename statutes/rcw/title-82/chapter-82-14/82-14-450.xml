It is the legislature's intent to allow general local governments to raise revenues in order to better protect the health and safety of Washington state and its residents. It is further the intent of the legislature to provide such local governments relief from regulatory burdens that do not harm the public health and safety of the citizens of the state as a means of minimizing the need to generate new revenues authorized under this act.&quot; [
