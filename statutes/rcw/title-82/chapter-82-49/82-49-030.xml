            <p>The legislature finds that the department of natural resources' derelict vessel removal program is seen as a national model for vessel removal, yet funding for the program is not sufficient to remove all sunken and abandoned vessels from state waters.</p>

            <p>The legislature finds that since 2002, the department's derelict vessel removal program has removed almost 1,000 vessels and eliminated environmental and habitat threats to some 10.6 cumulative miles of Washington's waters.</p>

            <p>The legislature further finds that the number of derelict vessels continues to increase due to insufficient funding to address the increased need as more vessels are added to the list each year, resulting in some vessels lingering for years. Currently, there are around 270 identified vessels of concern, or 7,500 linear feet of vessels. These derelict vessels have critical impacts on water quality, salmon, and southern resident killer whales.</p>
