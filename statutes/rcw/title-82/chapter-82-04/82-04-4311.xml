2005 c 86 s 2

Findings
—
2002 c 314:
&quot;The legislature finds that the provision of health services to those people who receive federal or state subsidized health care benefits by reason of age, disability, or lack of income is a recognized, necessary, and vital governmental function. As a result, the legislature finds that it would be inconsistent with that governmental function to tax amounts received by a public hospital or nonprofit hospital qualifying as a health and social welfare organization, when the amounts are paid under a health service program subsidized by federal or state government. Further, the tax status of these amounts should not depend on whether the amounts are received directly from the qualifying program or through a managed health care organization under contract to manage benefits for a qualifying program. Therefore, the legislature adopts this act to provide a clear and understandable deduction for these amounts, and to provide refunds for taxes paid as specified in section 4 of this act.&quot; [
