Intent
—
1997 c 238:
&quot;The legislature finds that many businesses have difficulty applying the small business credit under RCW
82.04.4451
. Further, the legislature appreciates the valuable time and resources small businesses expend on calculating the amount of credit based upon a statutory formula. For the purpose of tax simplification, it is the intent of this act to direct the department of revenue to create a schedule, in standard increments, to replace required calculations for the small business credit. Each taxpayer can make reference to the taxpayer's tax range on the schedule and find the amount of the taxpayer's small business credit. Further, no taxpayer will owe a greater amount of tax nor will any taxpayer be responsible for a greater amount of taxes otherwise due.&quot; [
