Findings
—
2023 c 286:
&quot;The legislature finds that Washington state's local newspapers and online digital news publishers are important providers of journalism in their communities. Across the state and the country, local newspapers are vanishing at an alarming rate.
Since the advent of the internet, Washington state newspapers, large and small, have experienced severe financial losses that caused layoffs and reduced journalistic capacity. Between 2005 and 2020, Washington state newspapers lost 67 percent of their newsroom employees. Many print media organizations operate at a deficit due to disruption of traditional revenue streams and even the surviving legacy news organizations are cutting staff and circulation. Washington state has lost more than two dozen weeklies and three dailies since 2004. The decline of these journalistic institutions represents a threat to democracy, government accountability, and civic engagement.
A Portland State University study found that the loss of local journalism is correlated to a decline in civic engagement, both nationally and in Washington state, which includes contacting a public office to express an opinion, participating in school groups, community associations, or civic organizations, and serving on a committee of any group or organization.
The legislature finds that local journalism can help keep watch over health trends in the community by identifying and preventing disease. The legislature finds that rural and underserved communities are the hardest hit in the area of public health when newspapers decline.
The legislature finds that local journalism helps combat government corruption and holds powerful institutions accountable.
Newspapers in Washington state have lobbied and editorialized for open public records, and fought attempts to rein in frivolous requests, costing local and state governments millions of dollars each year.

Findings
—
2023 c 286:
&quot;The legislature finds that Washington state's local newspapers and online digital news publishers are important providers of journalism in their communities. Across the state and the country, local newspapers are vanishing at an alarming rate.
Since the advent of the internet, Washington state newspapers, large and small, have experienced severe financial losses that caused layoffs and reduced journalistic capacity. Between 2005 and 2020, Washington state newspapers lost 67 percent of their newsroom employees. Many print media organizations operate at a deficit due to disruption of traditional revenue streams and even the surviving legacy news organizations are cutting staff and circulation. Washington state has lost more than two dozen weeklies and three dailies since 2004. The decline of these journalistic institutions represents a threat to democracy, government accountability, and civic engagement.
A Portland State University study found that the loss of local journalism is correlated to a decline in civic engagement, both nationally and in Washington state, which includes contacting a public office to express an opinion, participating in school groups, community associations, or civic organizations, and serving on a committee of any group or organization.
The legislature finds that local journalism can help keep watch over health trends in the community by identifying and preventing disease. The legislature finds that rural and underserved communities are the hardest hit in the area of public health when newspapers decline.
The legislature finds that local journalism helps combat government corruption and holds powerful institutions accountable.
Newspapers in Washington state have lobbied and editorialized for open public records, and fought attempts to rein in frivolous requests, costing local and state governments millions of dollars each year.
