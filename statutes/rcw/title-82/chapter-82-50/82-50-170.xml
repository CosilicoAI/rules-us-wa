The department of licensing shall review such application for refund, and, if it determines that an erroneous payment has been made by the taxpayer, it shall certify the amount to be refunded to the state treasurer that such person is entitled to a refund in such amount together with interest at the rate specified in RCW
82.32.060

If due to error the department or its agents has failed to collect the full amount of the license fee and excise tax due, which underpayment is in the amount of ten dollars or more, the department shall charge and collect such additional amount as will constitute full payment of the tax and any penalties or interest at the rate specified in RCW
