            <p>In order to meet the intent of chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. of promoting a sustainable, local renewable energy industry, the legislature prefers award of the majority of the installation of shared commercial solar projects be given to contractors based in Washington state. In the event the majority of the installation of a shared commercial solar project is awarded to out-of-state contractors, the administrator must submit to the Washington State University extension energy program the reasons for using out-of-state contractors, the percentage of installation work performed by out-of-state contractors, and a cost comparison of the installation services performed by out-of-state contractors against the same services performed by Washington-based contractors.
