Telecommunications and ancillary services taxes
—
Identification of taxable and nontaxable charges.
If a taxing jurisdiction does not subject some charges for ancillary services or telecommunications service, as those terms are defined in RCW
82.04.065
, to taxation, but these charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges that are subject to taxation, then the charges for nontaxable ancillary services or telecommunications service, as those terms are defined in RCW
82.04.065
, may be subject to taxation unless the telecommunications service provider or ancillary services provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to the tax, charge, or fee from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business and for purposes other than merely allocating the sales price of an aggregated charge to the individually aggregated items.
