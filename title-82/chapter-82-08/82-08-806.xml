            <p>The legislature finds that the printing and publishing industries have not been able to realize the benefits of the manufacturer's machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption to the same extent as other manufacturing industries due to dramatic changes in business methods caused by computer technology not contemplated when the manufacturer's machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption was adopted. As a result of these changes in business methods, a substantial amount of computer equipment used by printers and publishers is not eligible for the manufacturer's machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption because the computer equipment is not used within the manufacturing site.</p>

            <p>The legislature further finds that additional incentives for printers and publishers need to be adopted to provide these industries with similar benefits as the manufacturer's machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption provides for other manufacturing industries, and in recognition of the rapid rate of technological advancement in business methods undergone by the printing and publishing industries. The legislature intends to accomplish this by providing a sales and use tax exemption to printers and publishers for computer equipment, not otherwise eligible for the manufacturer's machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption, used primarily in the printing or publishing of printed material, and for labor and services rendered in respect to installing, repairing, cleaning, altering, or improving such computer equipment.&quot; [
