Tax preference performance statement
—
2019 c 288 ss 18 and 19:
&quot;This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 18 and 19, chapter 288, Laws of 2019. This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>

            <p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in Washington. It is the legislature's intent to extend the expiration date of and expand the existing sales and use tax exemption for machinery and equipment used directly in generating certain types of alternative energy, in order to reduce the price charged to customers for that machinery and equipment, thereby inducing some customers to buy machinery and equipment for alternative energy when they might not otherwise, thereby displacing electricity from fossil-fueled generating resources, thereby reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in Washington. It is also the intent of the legislature to maximize cost savings associated with clean energy construction for Washington electric customers by encouraging development of these resources in time for projects to benefit from both this incentive and expiring federal incentives.</p>

Intent

2013 2nd sp.s. c 13:
&quot;It is the intent of the legislature to help promote energy independence in the state of Washington and to better position Washington to attract a vibrant clean energy technology manufacturing sector to the state. The purpose of the tax preference created in part XV of this act is to incentivize electricity generation from renewable energy sources, reducing the costs of transitioning to these sources and technologies by exempting machinery, equipment, and labor and service charges associated with such electricity generation from the retail sales and use tax. This tax preference makes the most of the local renewable resources, protects us from the price volatility of certain fossil fuel sources, and helps the state achieve its greenhouse gas emissions targets. In addition, promoting manufacture and installation of facilities capable of generating power from renewable sources can create economic benefits in both rural and urban counties, creating high quality jobs and developing a skilled workforce in an industry sector in which significant job growth is anticipated over the coming decades.&quot; [
