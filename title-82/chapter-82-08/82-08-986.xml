              <p>For purposes of this subsection:
(A) For exemption certificates issued before June 9, 2022, family wage employment positions are new permanent employment positions requiring 40 hours of weekly work, or their equivalent, on a full-time basis assigned to an eligible computer data center and receiving a wage equivalent to or greater than 150 percent of the per capita personal income of the county in which the qualified project is located as published by the employment security department. The per capita personal income to be used to determine qualification for any year is the amount that was established for the immediate prior year.
(B) For exemption certificates issued on or after June 9, 2022, family wage employment positions are new permanent employment positions requiring 40 hours of weekly work, or their equivalent, on a full-time basis assigned to an eligible computer data center and receiving a wage equivalent to or greater than 125 percent of the per capita personal income of the county in which the qualified project is located as published by the employment security department. The per capita personal income to be used to determine qualification for any year is the amount that was established for the immediate prior year.
(C) An employment position may not be counted as a family wage employment position unless the employment position is entitled to health insurance coverage provided by the employer of the employment position.
(D) &quot;New permanent employment position&quot; means an employment position that did not exist or that had not previously been filled as of the date that the department issued an exemption certificate to the qualifying business or qualifying tenant of an eligible computer data center, as the case may be, except as provided in (b)(ii)(C) of this subsection</p>

            <p>The legislature further finds that the data center industry is experiencing explosive growth across the nation and the competition among states for data center investments has increased dramatically. A department of commerce study,

            <p>The legislature recognizes that rural county data center investments are necessary but insufficient for the state's total economy and competitiveness. Washington is the only state that restricts incentives geographically. As a result, data centers serving urban counties requiring higher performance and that offer colocation services for multiple tenants that foster technology ecosystems are lost to other states, particularly neighboring Oregon.</p>

            <p>The legislature further finds that data centers are one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building. In addition, the legislature finds that it is imperative that the economic expansion of data centers not result in negative environmental impacts to the communities in which the data centers are located. To this end, the legislature encourages data centers to be good environmental stewards for their community through adopting practices to mitigate negative environmental impacts of data centers, such as the use of energy derived from renewable resources, redirecting waste heat for alternative uses, or other industrial symbiosis practices.</p>

            <p>The legislature therefore intends to encourage additional investments in data technology facilities through expanding and extending the current sales and use tax exemption for rural county data centers and establishing a sales and use tax exemption pilot program for data centers in counties with populations over 800,000, which will in turn incentivize local economic development, increased local tax revenues, and construction and trade jobs across Washington through the development of additional data center facilities.&quot; [

It is the legislature's intent to provide a sales and use tax exemption on eligible server equipment and power infrastructure installed in eligible computer data centers, charges made for labor and services rendered in respect to installing eligible server equipment, and for construction, installation, repair, alteration, or improvement of eligible power infrastructures in order to increase investment in data center construction in rural Washington counties, thereby adding real and personal property to state and local property tax rolls, thereby increasing the rural county tax base.</p>
