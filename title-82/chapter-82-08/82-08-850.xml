            <p>If a buyer of conifer seed is normally engaged in growing timber both within and outside Washington and is not able to determine at the time of purchase whether the seed acquired, or the seedlings germinated from the seed acquired, will be used for growing timber within or outside Washington, the buyer may defer payment of the sales tax until it is determined that the seed, or seedlings germinated from the seed, will be planted for growing timber in Washington. A buyer that does not pay sales tax on the purchase of conifer seed and subsequently determines that the sale did not qualify for the tax exemption must remit to the department the amount of sales tax that would have been paid at the time of purchase.</p>

            <p>A buyer who pays retail sales tax on the purchase of conifer seed and subsequently determines that the sale qualifies for the tax exemption provided in this section is entitled to a deduction on the buyer's tax return equal to the cost to the buyer of the purchased seed. The deduction is allowed only if the buyer keeps and preserves records that show from whom the seed was purchased, the date of the purchase, the amount of the purchase, and the tax that was paid.

NOTES:
Finding
—
Intent
—
2001 c 129:
&quot;The legislature finds that in-state sellers of conifer seed and persons growing customer-owned conifer seed into seedlings are placed at a marketplace disadvantage compared to persons doing the same activity out of state because of the unique storage and growing requirements of conifer seed. It is the intent of the legislature to eliminate this disadvantage by providing a limited sales tax exemption for the sale of conifer seed to be used to grow timber outside Washington, or sold to an Indian tribe or member to grow timber in Indian country, if upon sale the seed is immediately placed into freezer storage operated by the seller.&quot; [

Retroactive application

2001 c 129:
