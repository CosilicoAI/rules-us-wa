Tax preference performance statement
—
2015 3rd sp.s. c 6 ss 702 and 703:
&quot;This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in sections 702 and 703 of this act. This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>

            <p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief for certain businesses or individuals, as indicated in RCW

          <content>
            <p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to support the forest products industry due in part to the industry's efforts to support the local economy by focusing on Washington state based resources thereby reducing global environmental impacts through the manufacturing and use of wood. It is the legislature's intent to provide the forest products industry permanent tax relief by lowering the public utility tax rate attributable to log transportation businesses. Because this reduced public utility rate is intended to be permanent, the reduced rate established in this Part VII is not subject to the ten-year expiration provision in RCW
