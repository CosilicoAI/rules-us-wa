            <p>To determine the annual license fee for a registration year, the appropriate dollar amount in the schedule is multiplied by the cumulative fuel tax rate per gallon of special fuel effective on July 1st of the preceding calendar year and the product is divided by 12 cents. The annual license fee must be rounded to the nearest five cents.</p>
