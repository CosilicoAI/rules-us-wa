1998 c 313:
&quot;It is the intent of the legislature to attract and retain businesses that provide professional services and insurance services to international customers. To that end, the legislature finds that an incentive measured by a business's growth in jobs is a meaningful method of attracting and retaining such businesses. Therefore, the incentive in this act is specifically targeted at &quot;net new jobs.&quot; In addition, to further the impact and benefit of this program, this incentive is limited to those urban areas of the state, both in eastern Washington and western Washington, that are characterized by unemployment and poverty. The legislature finds that providing this targeted incentive will be of benefit to the state as a whole.&quot; [
