            <p>In adopting the state's business and occupation tax, the legislature intended to tax virtually all business activities carried on within the state. See Simpson Inv. Co. v. Dep't of Revenue, 141 Wn.2d 139, 149</p>

            <p>One of the major business and occupation tax exemptions is provided in RCW
82.04.360
for income earned as an employee or servant as distinguished from income earned as an independent contractor. The legislature's intent in providing this exemption was to exempt employee wages from the business and occupation tax but not to exempt income earned as an independent contractor.</p>

            <p>The legislature finds that corporate directors are not employees or servants of the corporation whose board they serve on and therefore are not entitled to a business and occupation tax exemption under RCW
82.04.360
. The legislature further finds that there are no business and occupation tax exemptions for compensation received for serving as a member of a corporation's board of directors.</p>

            <p>The legislature also finds that there is a widespread misunderstanding among corporate directors that the business and occupation tax does not apply to the compensation they receive for serving as a director of a corporation. It is the legislature's expectation that the department of revenue will take appropriate measures to ensure that corporate directors understand and comply with their business and occupation tax obligations with respect to their director compensation. However, because of the widespread misunderstanding by corporate directors of their liability for business and occupation tax on director compensation, the legislature finds that it is appropriate in this unique situation to provide limited relief against the retroactive assessment of business and occupation taxes on corporate director compensation.</p>
