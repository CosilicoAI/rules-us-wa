Intent

2005 c 301:
&quot;The legislature finds that the welfare of the people of the state of Washington is positively impacted through the encouragement and expansion of key growth industries in the state. The legislature further finds that targeting tax incentives to focus on key growth industries is an important strategy to enhance the state's business climate.
A recent report by the Washington State University energy program recognized the solar electric industry as one of the state's important growth industries. It is of great concern that businesses in this industry have been increasingly expanding and relocating their operations elsewhere. The report indicates that additional incentives for the solar electric industry are needed in recognition of the unique forces and issues involved in business decisions in this industry.
Therefore, the legislature intends to enact comprehensive tax incentives for the solar electric industry that address activities of the manufacture of these products and to encourage these industries to locate in Washington. Tax incentives for the solar electric industry are important in both retention and expansion of existing business and attraction of new businesses, all of which will strengthen this growth industry within our state, will create jobs, and will bring many indirect benefits to the state.&quot; [
