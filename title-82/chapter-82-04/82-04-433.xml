            <p>Through this act the legislature intends to address the taxation of persons manufacturing and/or selling bunker fuel. Bunker fuel is fuel intended for consumption outside the waters of the United States by vessels in foreign commerce. Although the state has historically collected tax from bunker fuel manufacturers, recently questions have arisen whether the manufacture of bunker fuel is subject to business and occupation tax under RCW
82.04.240
. Pursuant to this act, the activity is taxable under RCW
82.04.240
.</p>

          <content>
            <p>The legislature finds that at the time the deduction allowed under RCW
82.04.433
was enacted in 1985, it was intended to apply only to the wholesaling or retailing of bunker fuel. In 1987 the legislature enacted the multiple activities tax credit in RCW
82.04.440
. Enactment of the multiple activities tax credit resulted in changed tax liability for certain taxpayers. In particular, some taxpayers that engaged in activities that had been exempt under the prior multiple activities exemption became subject to tax on manufacturing activities upon enactment of the multiple activities tax credit in its place. The manufacturing of bunker fuel is one such activity.&quot; [
