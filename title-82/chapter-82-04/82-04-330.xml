NOTES:
Tax preference performance statement
—
2015 3rd sp.s. c 6 ss 1102-1106:
&quot;This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in this Part XI. This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.
It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to support the honey bee industry and provide tax relief to eligible apiarists. Honey bees pollinate eighty percent of the nation's flowering crops, which include agricultural crops. They are vitally important to agriculture and an integral part of food production. Therefore, the legislature intends to permanently include eligible apiarists within the definition of farmer and define honey bee products as agricultural products so that they may receive the same tax relief as that provided to other sectors of agriculture. Because the legislature intends for the changes in this Part XI to be permanent, they are exempt from the ten-year expiration provision in RCW
82.32.805
