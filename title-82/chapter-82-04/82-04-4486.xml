            <p>In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed to a buyer of syrup to be used by the buyer in making carbonated beverages that are sold by the buyer if the tax imposed by RCW

has been paid in respect to the syrup. The amount of the credit shall be equal to twenty-five percent from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, fifty percent from July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008, seventy-five percent from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, and one hundred percent after June 30, 2009, of the taxes imposed under RCW
