Findings

Intent
—
2019 c 426 ss 2 and 3:
&quot;In 1995, the legislature enacted a business and occupation tax rate for persons providing international investment management services. The legislature finds that the original intent of this tax rate was to reduce a competitive disadvantage for a limited number of firms providing international investment management services. The fiscal note for the bill stated that &quot;only a very limited taxpayer group would benefit from the reduced rate.&quot; The legislature further finds that as a result of the adoption of economic nexus; a single factor, market-based apportionment methodology; and significant ambiguity in the statute governing the qualifications for the tax rate; a much larger number of businesses are claiming the tax rate than was contemplated in 1995. Therefore, the legislature intends in sections 2 and 3 of this act to clarify the scope of activities and persons eligible for the tax rate to more closely align with the legislature's original intent.&quot; [

Intent
—
2019 c 426 ss 2 and 3:
&quot;In 1995, the legislature enacted a business and occupation tax rate for persons providing international investment management services. The legislature finds that the original intent of this tax rate was to reduce a competitive disadvantage for a limited number of firms providing international investment management services. The fiscal note for the bill stated that &quot;only a very limited taxpayer group would benefit from the reduced rate.&quot; The legislature further finds that as a result of the adoption of economic nexus; a single factor, market-based apportionment methodology; and significant ambiguity in the statute governing the qualifications for the tax rate; a much larger number of businesses are claiming the tax rate than was contemplated in 1995. Therefore, the legislature intends in sections 2 and 3 of this act to clarify the scope of activities and persons eligible for the tax rate to more closely align with the legislature's original intent.&quot; [

Intent

2019 c 426 ss 2 and 3:
&quot;In 1995, the legislature enacted a business and occupation tax rate for persons providing international investment management services. The legislature finds that the original intent of this tax rate was to reduce a competitive disadvantage for a limited number of firms providing international investment management services. The fiscal note for the bill stated that &quot;only a very limited taxpayer group would benefit from the reduced rate.&quot; The legislature further finds that as a result of the adoption of economic nexus; a single factor, market-based apportionment methodology; and significant ambiguity in the statute governing the qualifications for the tax rate; a much larger number of businesses are claiming the tax rate than was contemplated in 1995. Therefore, the legislature intends in sections 2 and 3 of this act to clarify the scope of activities and persons eligible for the tax rate to more closely align with the legislature's original intent.&quot; [

Findings

Intent
—
2019 c 426 ss 2 and 3:
&quot;In 1995, the legislature enacted a business and occupation tax rate for persons providing international investment management services. The legislature finds that the original intent of this tax rate was to reduce a competitive disadvantage for a limited number of firms providing international investment management services. The fiscal note for the bill stated that &quot;only a very limited taxpayer group would benefit from the reduced rate.&quot; The legislature further finds that as a result of the adoption of economic nexus; a single factor, market-based apportionment methodology; and significant ambiguity in the statute governing the qualifications for the tax rate; a much larger number of businesses are claiming the tax rate than was contemplated in 1995. Therefore, the legislature intends in sections 2 and 3 of this act to clarify the scope of activities and persons eligible for the tax rate to more closely align with the legislature's original intent.&quot; [
