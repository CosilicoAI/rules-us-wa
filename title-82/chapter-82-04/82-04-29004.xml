NOTES:
Finding
—
2019 c 420:
&quot;The legislature finds that in the decade since the great recession, some economic sectors have rebounded, stronger than ever, while many Washington families struggle to afford basic necessities, all while also carrying the burden of funding schools and essential services. The wealth disparity in the country between the wealthy few and the lowest income families is wider than in any other developed nation and continues to grow. Additionally, Washington's tax system disproportionately impacts those with the least ability to pay. As a percentage of household income, middle-income families in Washington pay two to four times the amount of taxes as compared to top earners in the state. Low-income Washington families pay six times more in taxes than the wealthiest residents. The legislature concludes that those wealthy few who have profited the most from the recent economic expansion can contribute to the essential services and programs all Washington families need.&quot; [

Finding
—
2019 c 420:
&quot;The legislature finds that in the decade since the great recession, some economic sectors have rebounded, stronger than ever, while many Washington families struggle to afford basic necessities, all while also carrying the burden of funding schools and essential services. The wealth disparity in the country between the wealthy few and the lowest income families is wider than in any other developed nation and continues to grow. Additionally, Washington's tax system disproportionately impacts those with the least ability to pay. As a percentage of household income, middle-income families in Washington pay two to four times the amount of taxes as compared to top earners in the state. Low-income Washington families pay six times more in taxes than the wealthiest residents. The legislature concludes that those wealthy few who have profited the most from the recent economic expansion can contribute to the essential services and programs all Washington families need.&quot; [
